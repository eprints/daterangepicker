The 'daterangepicker' ingredient is designed to extend EPrints 3.4 by adding support for graphical date pickers.
These date pickers can be used as a form input renderer (render\_input) for fields of type datepicker.
jQuery is also required. From EPrints 3.4.3 this is available as an additional pacakged ingredient which will 
need to be enabled.  Otherwise get these files from https://github.com/eprints/eprints3.4/tree/master/ingredients/jquery
